title: ef4m: Enhancements Framework 4 Moodle
---

<h1>Welcome to Enhancements Framework 4 Moodle (ef4m) community site</h1>
<p>Ef4m (pronounced efform) draws inspiration from modern JavaScript guidelines and frameworks, open-source scripting in Linux, and VBA type customisations in Microsoft Office as found in banking, finance and trading.</p>
<p><a href="guidelines.html">Ef4m is a set of guidelines to help us create centrally managed, reusable, testable and shareable enhancements/extensions to Moodle</a> using JavaScript. It is a framework created to allow us to use existing Moodle infrastructure, and staff’s familiarity with Moodle as an advantage and a bedrock to enhance students’ learning experience, instead of rebuilding everything from the ground up.</p>
<p>The framework is built to allow all Moodle users with editing rights to create extensions to Moodle, effectively opening open-source contributions to Moodle from thousands more users that can write simple JavaScript scripts but cannot build or install Moodle plugins.</p>
<h2>Under construction</h2>
<p>Currently we are in the process of building this community website around ef4m. Here you will soon find 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="guidelines.html">the guidelines listed and presented in detail</a>, but also
        </li>
        <li>
            guidance on best practices
        </li>
        <li>
            enhancements created by me so that you can use them directly in your Moodle courses if they solve issues you also face
        </li>
        <li>
            libraries you can use to make creation of enhancements faster
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>You are invited to submit enhancements you create via github pull requests.</p>
